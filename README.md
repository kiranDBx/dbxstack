# dbxstack

## Overview
`dbxstack` is a practical, hands-on repository showcasing multi-database and multi-cloud infrastructure automation with a focus on database migrations, scaling, and DevOps/DBOps best practices. The repo includes Terraform examples, automation snippets, and notes simulating real-world production environments for cloud-native database management.

## Why This Matters
Modern database roles demand expertise across various cloud providers, database types, and automation frameworks. This repo captures core challenges like migrating on-prem databases to cloud DBaaS, scaling cloud databases efficiently, and automating routine tasks â€” all critical skills for long-term success in cloud DBA and database engineering roles.

## Key Components

- **Terraform Modules**  
  Infrastructure as Code examples for AWS RDS scaling, designed for real-world cloud deployments.

- **Multi-Cloud Focus**  
  While starting with AWS, the structure supports adding other cloud providers (GCP, Azure) and multiple database types (Oracle, PostgreSQL, NoSQL).

- **Automation Snippets**  
  Shell/Python scripts for backup automation, monitoring hooks, and failover handling.

- **Documentation & Best Practices**  
  Clear, production-oriented notes inside each module explaining architecture, deployment steps, and operational considerations.
